# Contributions to the ABAP Platform Trial Image Documentation

Found a mistake in our documentation? Always wanted to change some description
or add a step in one of our procedures that could save many others much time?
ABAP Cloud Developer Trial (and its previous incarnations, ABAP Platform Trial and SAP AS ABAP 7.x, Developer Edition) has always thrived on contributions from SAP Community.

If you have:

 - Found a mistake in our documentation?
 - Always wanted to change some description/ or add a step in one of our procedures
 - Done something cool (with ABAP Trial, that is), which you want to share...
... then please submit your feedback to the FAQs file via a pull request. I will monitor this repo and add wherever possible:
